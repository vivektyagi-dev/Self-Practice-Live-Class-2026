# 🚀 Live Class 2026 — Agentic AI 3.0 Specialization

**All code, notebooks, diagrams, and class-by-class notes for the live Agentic AI 3.0 Specialization with AgentOps.**
🎙️ Mentor: **Mayank Aggarwal** · 🏫 Krish Naik Academy · 🗓️ Every Saturday & Sunday, 8–11 AM IST

📖 **[Mayank's running notes, Colab links & escalated Q&A →](https://bugs-sleep-6uj.craft.me/agentic3)** · 📄 [Full course brochure (PDF)](<Agentic-3-0.pdf>)

🧰 **New here? Start with [Prerequisites & First-Time Setup](<PREREQUISITES.md>)** — Python, UV, VS Code, and API keys, all in one place before Class 01.
📖 **Revising a term?** Check the [Glossary](<GLOSSARY.md>) — every recurring concept, one line each, linked back to where it was first taught.

## 🗺️ How This Repo Is Organized

The course runs **every Saturday & Sunday**, so the repo is organized the same way you attend it: one **`Weekend NN - Date(s)/`** folder per calendar weekend, each nesting the real dated class folder(s) — code, notebooks, and Excalidraw diagrams exactly as built live. Every individual class also gets a **beautifully written summary** in [`classes_summary/`](<classes_summary/>), in the spirit of the mermaid-diagram-driven notes format the course community loves.

```

Open **any** `Weekend NN/` folder on GitHub for a joint recap of both days that weekend, or open a dated class folder inside it and its own `README.md` renders right there with a quick overview and a link to the full write-up — you never have to go hunting for context. A few code folders span two calendar weekends because the same live-coding session continued across them (e.g. Class 02 → Class 03); those live in the earlier weekend, and the later weekend's `README.md` links straight back to it.

```

This repository currently covers **Phase 0 through the middle of Phase 2** (Classes 00–12) — raw-Python fundamentals all the way through LangChain's middleware system.

## 🎬 Recurring Projects You'll See Throughout

| Project | First appears | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Project Zero** | Class 04 | The hand-built raw-Python agent — model, tools, memory, Streamlit UI |
| **CineBot** | Class 09 | A movie-ticket booking agent — the vehicle for Structured Output & Tools |
| **TripMate** | Class 11 | A travel-planning agent with real weather, search, and SQLite persistence |

## 🧰 Tooling Used Across the Course

- 🐍 **Python 3.10+** managed with **[UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** — every class folder with code has its own `pyproject.toml`
- 🔑 Free-tier LLM access via **Groq** and **OpenRouter**; paid via **OpenAI** / **Anthropic** — always via `.env`, never committed (`.env.example` ships in every project instead)
- 📓 **Google Colab** for line-by-line learning; **VS Code** for real, multi-file projects
- 🎨 **Excalidraw** for the architecture diagrams sketched live in class

## ▶️ Running Any Class's Code

Every code folder is an independent [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) project — `cd` into the dated class folder *inside* its `Weekend NN/` parent:

```bash
cd "Weekend 03 - 11-12 Jul/06 - 12 Jul - Introduction to LangChain"
uv sync
cp .env.example .env   # fill in at least one free key
uv run main.py
```
